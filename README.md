# UdacityProject_DehradunHandbook
This is a Tour Guide App that I made for my Udacity Android Development Nanodegree. The app lets the user browse information about the city of Dehradun, India. The app gives four options, and then goes deeper into those options using a tabbed interface. The images are sourced from the internet, the text belongs to DehradunBuzz.com and the icon was generated using https://jgilfelt.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-launcher.html
